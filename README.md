# Fish weight project

This is the repo for the *greyhound data* fish weight project. This project involves creating a regression model to predict the weight of a fish based on features like species and certain length measurements and turning this into a streamlit app.

This repo contains the notebooks used for basic data analysis and model training, as well as the trained model itself, and a Streamlit app which runs the trained model in real time.

The purpose of this project was to create a Streamlit app, and so the other stages of the ML workflow are quite brief and in less detail than I would do in a real project.

If you wish to explore the notebooks used for this project, please consider them in the following order:
- Basic EDA
- Data Processing
- Modelling Experiments
- Hyperparamter Tuning
- FinalModel

The code for the Streamlit app is in `app.py`.
